# FAQ: OpenGL rendering

## Are there any resources on how the OpenGL renderer in the community maintained version can be used?

Render with `--renderer=opengl`; add `-l` (or `--live-preview`) for an
interactive preview window. Both renderers draw the same mobjects, so the rest of
the documentation applies to both. Surfaces ({class}`.Surface`,
{class}`.ParametricSurface`, {class}`.MeshMobject`) are drawn by both; the OpenGL
renderer lights them per pixel and hides what is behind them with a depth test.

Earlier versions had separate OpenGL mobject classes (`OpenGLMobject`,
`OpenGLVMobject`, `OpenGLSurface`, ...); see
{doc}`../guides/opengl_mobjects_migration` for how to update code that used them.

## I am trying to run an interactive scene with `--renderer=opengl` and `Scene.interactive_embed`, but an error (`sqlite3.ProgrammingError`) is raised. How can I fix this?

This seems to be an issue with a recent IPython release,
in our experience it helps to downgrade the installed `IPython`
package to `8.0.1`: `pip install IPython==8.0.1`.
